# LeaftyNodeUtils

This is a set of node utilities that make my life easier. Since I'm implementing these on most of our lambdas, it was a good idea to extract it into its own repository, so it can be fetched with npm.

This is a public repository, but the only reason it's public is because it's not sensible enough to go through the hassle of making it private. I don't expect this to be useful to anyone.
